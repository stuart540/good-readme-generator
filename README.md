  ## Description
  
  The aim of this project is to create a command line interface which will generate a README file based off of user inputs. 
  
  While working on this project I have increased my knowledge of node.js and the use of npm applications; fs, inquirer and util. I also implemented JS modularization which helps by separating code into more manageable and secure sections.

  A future update would aim to improve the usability of the application by adding a checkbox selection of contents which the user can toggle to decide which subheadings to include in the README.
